# Streamline Card

![streamline-card-hero](./images/hero.png)

Streamline your Lovelace configuration with a powerful card template system.

This card is for [Lovelace](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace) on [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

## What is This Card?

Have you ever found yourself copying and pasting the same card configuration over and over in your Home Assistant dashboard? For example, you might have multiple light cards that all look the same, just with different entities. Every time you want to change how these cards look, you have to change each one individually. This is time-consuming and prone to errors.

This is where `streamline-card` comes to help! It allows you to:

- Create a template for your cards once
- Reuse that template multiple times
- Only change the template in one place to update all cards using it
- Use variables to customize each instance of the template
- Use JavaScript to make your cards dynamic and smart

[Example usage](#real-world-examples)

`streamline-card` is an adaptation by [@brunosabot](https://github.com/brunosabot) of [`decluttering-card`](https://github.com/custom-cards/decluttering-card) which is not maintained anymore.

## Installation

  There are two ways to install this card. The recommended way is through HACS (Home Assistant Community Store), but you can also install it manually.

  ### With HACS (Recommended)

  HACS is like an app store for Home Assistant. It makes installing and updating custom cards much easier. Here's how to install using HACS:

  - **Install HACS if you don't have it:**

    - If HACS is not installed yet, download it following the instructions on [https://hacs.xyz/docs/use/download/download/](https://hacs.xyz/docs/use/download/download/)
    - Follow the HACS initial configuration guide at [https://hacs.xyz/docs/configuration/basic](https://hacs.xyz/docs/configuration/basic)

  - **Install the Card:**

    - Go to `HACS` in your Home Assistant sidebar
    - Search for `Streamline Card` in HACS
    - Click on the card when you find it
    - Click the `Download` button at the bottom right

  > [!NOTE]  
  > - Follow those steps first to make sure the card is installed and working properly.  
  > - Usually, you would create a template for the card at this step, but we’ll skip that for now.    
  > - Once you know that the card is working you can head over to [Configuration](#configuration)

  - **Adding the Card:**
    - Go back to your dashboard
    - Click the menu icon (⋮) at the top right corner
    - Click `Edit dashboard`
    - Click `Add card` at the bottom right
    - Search for `Streamline Card`

  > [!WARNING]
  > If you don't see the card, try clearing your browser cache.

  ### Manual Installation

  If you prefer to install manually or can't use HACS, follow these steps:

  - **Download the Card:**
    - Download this file: [streamline-card.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brunosabot/streamline-card/main/dist/streamline-card.js)
    - Save it to your Home Assistant `<config>/www` folder

  - **Add to Resources:**
    - Go to your dashboard
    - Click the menu icon (⋮) at the top right
    - Click `Edit dashboard`
    - Click the menu icon again
    - Click `Manage resources`
    - Click `Add resource`
    - Enter `/local/streamline-card.js?v=1` in the URL field
    - Select `JavaScript Module`
    - Click `Create`

  - **Add to Dashboard:**
    - Refresh your browser page
    - Edit your dashboard
    - Click `Add card`
    - Search for `Streamline Card`

  > [!WARNING]
  > After updating the file, you'll need to change the version number in the URL (e.g., from `v=1` to `v=2`) to make sure your browser loads the new version.

## Configuration

Let's learn how to use this card step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding Templates
---

A template is like a blueprint for your cards. It defines how your card will look and behave, but leaves certain parts (variables) empty so you can fill them in later.

For example, let's say you want to create a template for a light card. The template might look like this:

```yaml
my_light_template:
  card:
    type: custom:bubble-card
    name: "[[room_name]] Light" # This will be filled in later
    icon: "[[light_icon]]" # This will be filled in later
    entity: "[[light_entity]]" # This will be filled in later
```

### Step 2: Setting Up Templates
---

There are two ways to set up your templates: through YAML files or through the UI. Let's look at both methods:

<details>
  <summary><strong>Method 1: YAML Configuration (Recommended when you have many Templates)</strong></summary>

  1. **Create a Templates Directory:**
    Create a folder called `streamline_templates` in your Home Assistant configuration directory.

  2. **Add Template Files:**
    In this folder, create YAML files for your templates. For example, `light_template.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    default:
      - light_icon: mdi:ceiling-light
    card:
      type: custom:bubble-card
      name: "[[room_name]] Light"
      icon: "[[light_icon]]"
      entity: "[[light_entity]]"
    ```

  3. **Include Templates in Dashboard:**
    In your dashboard configuration file, add:
    ```yaml
    streamline_templates: !include_dir_named ../streamline_templates/
    ```

  ---

  ##### ⚡️ Automatic Template File Loading and Fallback Locations

  > **Note:** An example template file, `streamline_templates.example.yaml`, is provided in the `dist/` directory of this repository. You can copy this file to any of the supported locations (such as `/config/www/community/streamline-card/` or `/config/www/streamline-card/`) and rename it to `streamline_templates.yaml` to get started quickly with your own templates.

  The `streamline-card` will automatically attempt to load the `streamline_templates.yaml` file from several locations, in the following order:

  1. `/config/www/community/streamline-card/streamline_templates.yaml` (default for HACS installations)
  2. `/config/www/streamline-card/streamline_templates.yaml` (commonly used for manual installations)

  If the file is not found in the first location, the card will try the next, and so on. This fallback mechanism ensures maximum compatibility with different Home Assistant setups.

  **What does this mean for you?**
  - You can place your `streamline_templates.yaml` file in any of these locations, depending on how you installed the card and your Home Assistant directory structure.
  - Only one file is needed; the card will use the first one it finds.
  - This makes it easy to provide or override templates without modifying the card code.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Method 2: UI Configuration (Easier for Beginners)</strong></summary>

1. **Open Raw Editor:**

   - Go to your dashboard
   - Click the menu icon (⋮)
   - Click `Raw configuration editor`

2. **Add Templates:**
   At the top of the file, add:
   ```yaml
   streamline_templates:
     my_light_template:
       default:
         - light_icon: mdi:ceiling-light
       card:
         type: custom:bubble-card
         name: "[[room_name]] Light"
         icon: "[[light_icon]]"
         entity: "[[light_entity]]"
   ```

</details>


### Step 3: Template Structure
---

Each template has three main parts:

1. **Template Name:**
   This is how you'll refer to your template later.

   ```yaml
   my_light_template: # This is the template name
   ```

2. **Default Values (Optional):**
   These are values that will be used if not specified when using the template.

   ```yaml
   default:
     - light_icon: mdi:ceiling-light
   ```

3. **Card Configuration:**
   This is the actual card configuration, with variables in double brackets.

   ```yaml
   card: # Use 'card' for normal cards
     type: custom:bubble-card
     name: "[[room_name]] Light"
     icon: "[[light_icon]]"
     entity: "[[light_entity]]"

   # OR

   element: # Use 'element' for picture-elements
     type: icon
     icon: "[[icon]]"
   ```


### Step 4: Using Variables
 ---

Variables are placeholders in your template that get replaced with actual values when you use the template. They are written with double brackets: `[[variable_name]]`

> [!TIP]
> 
> <strong>Some important rules about variables:</strong>
> - Always put them in double brackets: `[[like_this]]`
> - If a variable is alone on a line, put it in single quotes: `'[[variable_name]]'`
> - Variables can be used anywhere in the template
> - You can set default values for variables in the `default` section

### Step 5: Advanced Features - JavaScript Expressions
 ---

You can make your templates dynamic using JavaScript. Any key that ends with `_javascript` will be evaluated as JavaScript code.
The javascript code has access to the following data

- **states**: An object containing all states
- **user**: An object containing the current user information, for instance `user.name` or `user.is_admin`
- **variables**: An object containing all the variables you've defined in your template
- **areas**: An object containing all areas defined in Home Assistant, for instance you can use `areas.kitchen.icon`

Here's an example of a dynamic weather card that changes color based on temperature:

```yaml
weather_template:
  card:
    type: custom:bubble-card
    card_type: button
    button_type: state
    entity: "[[weather_entity]]"
    styles_javascript: |
      const temp = states['[[weather_entity]]'].attributes.temperature;
      return `
        .bubble-button-card-container {
          background-color: ${
            temp < 0 ? 'var(--info-color)' :
            temp > 30 ? 'var(--error-color)' :
            'var(--primary-color)'
          };
        }
      `;
```
